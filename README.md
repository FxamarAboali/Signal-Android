# Signal-LTS

A fork of Signal for Android.

[Install](https://github.com/benarmstead/Signal-LTS/releases/latest)

## Main differences to the official Signal app

- Does not send read receipts regardless of if they are enabled
- Does not send typing indicators regardless of if they are enabled
- Remotely deleted messages from users will be ignored, and still available on your device
- Defaults to using high quality mode for sending image`s
- Allows sending up to 100 media items at one time rather than signal's default 32

All other differences:

- Doesn't have popups asking for ratings on the play store
- Disables pin reminders by default
- Turns on incognito keyboard by default

Feel free to leave an [issue](https://github.com/benarmstead/Signal-LTS/issues) if you have any feature requests.
