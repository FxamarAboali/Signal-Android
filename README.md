# Signal-BA

Signal-BA is a fork of the popular encrypted messaging app Signal Android.

The main difference's between Signal-BA and the original Signal Android app are, Signal BA:

- Does not send read receipts
- Does not send typing indicators
- Disables other users from remote deleting messages on Signal BA

Other features which I am hoping to add are:

- Don't compress images and photos which are being sent

Feel free to leave an [issue](https://github.com/benarmstead/Signal-BA/issues) if you have any feature requests.

> Note: This fork is primarily developed for my own personal usage, features may or may not be added.
