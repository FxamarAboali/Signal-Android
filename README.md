# Pigeon Android

Pigeon provides encrypted calls and texts for the Punkt. MP02, which runs a radically stripped-down version of AOSP 8.1. It is developed upon Signal-Android source code and is designed with text-only UI specifically for small screen Android devices with physical keys (no touchscreen). Pigeon is available in APK format for installation on the MP02 via OTA. Modified versions of Pigeon can be installed on other Android/AOSP devices. 

Punkt. is an independent Swiss-based consumer electronics manufacturer ([punkt.ch](htttps://www.punkt.ch)).
