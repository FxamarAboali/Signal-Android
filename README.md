# Signal Plus for Android 

Signal Plus is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends forked from WhisperSystems Signal for adding more advanced options.

Signal Plus uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

Currently available on the Play store.
